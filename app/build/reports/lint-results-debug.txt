/workspace/openrouterchat/app/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 12 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: FullBackupContent, GradleDependency (10), ObsoleteLintCustomCheck [LintBaseline]
/workspace/openrouterchat/app/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 20 warnings were filtered out because they are listed in the baseline file, lint-baseline.xml
